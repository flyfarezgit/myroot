            <p><b>Introduction</b>: Welcome to the tripsfares.com
                ("Tripsfares.com," "we," "our," "us") website (collectively, the "Site"). Use of the Site is governed
                by the following terms and conditions. By using the Site you agree to these terms and conditions. If you
                do not agree with any part of these terms and conditions, you must not use the Site. We reserve the
                right to amend these terms and conditions at any time. All amended terms automatically take effect when
                these Terms &amp; Conditions are updated. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of

            <p>100% SAFE SHOPPING GUARANTEE tripsfares.com servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption
                technology that works with Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Safari, Netscape, and AOL's browser, so
                that only tripsfares.com can read a buyer's personal information. We guarantee that every purchase you
                make on the Tripsfares.com website will be 100% safe. Although we never intend to have an incident of
                credit card fraud, if unauthorized charges are made to your credit card as a result of doing business
                with Tripsfares.com, you will pay nothing. Shopping online at Tripsfares.com is statistically safer
                than using your credit card at a restaurant or department store. Technical experts point out that online
                purchases without human intervention are far safer than traditional credit card transactions because the
                information is immediately encrypted into a scrambled message that can only be decrypted by an
                authorized computer. You will join millions of other customers who have safely shopped over the
                Internet. We're certain after successfully shopping online at Tripsfares.com; you will be on your way
                to appreciating the convenience and security of shopping from home. The Fair Credit Billing Act states
                that your credit card provider cannot make you pay in excess of $50 of fraudulent charges. If your
                credit card provider does have you pay any of the $50 it can charge, Tripsfares.com will cover the
                expense, up to the full $50 if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of
                your own from purchases made on the Tripsfares.com website while using Tripsfares.com's secure server.
            </p>

            <p>
                If such an event does occur, you must notify your credit card provider. General Disclaimer
                Tripsfares.com shall not be liable for failure of travel service suppliers, including but not limited
                to airlines, hotels, cruise lines, railroads, car rental agencies, tour operators and consolidators to
                perform the services offered by such suppliers. Tripsfares.com, in providing travel management
                services, does not guarantee or insure the services to be provided by any supplier, the financial
                position of such suppliers or the reimbursement to you from any loss experienced as a result of the
                financial condition of such supplier. In the event that a supplier defaults prior to providing the
                service to you for which payment has been made, the sole recourse for refund shall be with the
                defaulting supplier, from insurance covering such defaults if any or from other responsible third party
                unless such was caused by Tripsfares.com. In those situations in which a supplier defaults prior to
                providing services you may pursue any recourse against the supplier for refund, which may be permitted
                by law or statute. Tripsfares.com warrants that it provides the highest standards of service in the
                trade and will use appropriate care in selecting suppliers so as to protect you from such default.
                Except as expressly stated herein, Tripsfares.com assumes no responsibility for actions relating to
                travel services beyond the control of Tripsfares.com or its employees.
            </p>
            
            <p>Tripsfares.com is not responsible or liable for any act, error, omission, injury, loss, accident,
                damage, delay, non-performance, irregularity, or any consequence thereof, which may be occasioned
                through neglect, or default or any other act or inaction of any supplier of Travel products.
                Tripsfares.com shall not be liable for any fluctuation in price or change in schedule or equipment or
                accommodations for any travel service, which occurs subsequent to payment for such service.
                Tripsfares.com acts as a service bureau that provides value added service to retail travel agents and
                consumers. Tripsfares.com has no control over and assumes no liability for the actions of the suppliers
                from whom it obtains Travel products. Once tickets have been issued there may be a penalty involved for
                refunds. We do not have control over printed prices on the tickets, although some tickets may have BT
                (Bulk fare) printed on them, some may have a specific value on them, which may be different (lower or
                higher) than the fare collected. Discounts offered may vary depending on a number of factors including
                Airlines utilized, class of service, destination, time of year (low, mid or high season), advance notice
                provided, minimum stay requirements fulfilled and flight load. Tripsfares.com does not guarantee,
                endorse, validate or promote other advertiser products and services that are advertised on this web
                Site.</p>

            <p><strong>Booking Process</strong></p>

            <p>For your convenience, our use of the following terms in these Terms &amp; Conditions shall have the
                meaning below: "Service Element" - a singular product or service listed on the Site that can be booked
                independently of any other service. "Travel Supplier" - a vendor of one or more Service Elements. (e.g.:
                hotels, car suppliers, airlines). Tripsfares.com does not act as principal but makes arrangements with
                third-party vendor Travel Suppliers for Service Elements, all as defined above. "Booking" - a
                negotiation process with the Travel Supplier carried out by you while using this Site for the purpose of
                obtaining one or more Service Elements that may result in a contract with the Travel Supplier at the
                time we receive full payment and accept your offer. In order to complete a Booking the following steps
                are taken to ensure its validity: When we place Service Elements on our Site, we are inviting you to
                make an offer for their purchase.</p>
            <p> You do not make this offer until you press "Book" on the payment page (entitled "Review Trip Details and
                Book") of the Site. Once you have done so you have made Tripsfares.com an offer (which cannot be
                withdrawn if you change your mind) to purchase the relevant Service Element(s) from the relevant Travel
                Supplier(s) (your "Booking"). We are free to accept your offer on behalf of the relevant Travel Supplier
                or to reject it, at our sole discretion. The Tripsfares.com email confirmation is NOT the contractual
                acceptance of the Booking, but merely an acknowledgement that we have received your offer. We will need
                to check the availability of the relevant Service Element(s).</p>
            <p> If the relevant Service Element is available, your Booking will be processed. The contract pertaining to
                the relevant Booking is formed when payment in full has been received. The contract between you and the
                relevant Travel Supplier will relate only to those Service Elements confirmed by email with ticket
                numbers in case of air or reservation numbers in case of hotels, cars or activities. The terms of your
                Booking (such as price, availability and/or dates of travel) are not guaranteed until the contract is
                formed between you and the Travel Supplier and a ticket has been issued and/or a reservation has been
                made and confirmed by the Travel Supplier. Please note that once you have completed the Booking stage
                you can only cancel or change the details (such as names or destinations) of your Booking at our sole
                discretion and in accordance with these Terms &amp; Conditions. </p>
            <p>These Booking processes will apply to any of our individual Service Element's Terms &amp; Conditions set
                out below. The airline ticket Terms &amp; Conditions, the hotel Terms &amp; Conditions, the car rental
                Terms &amp; Conditions, the attractions and services Terms &amp; Conditions supplement any area not
                covered by the Booking process. We reserve the right to change the Booking process at any time, with
                changes automatically taking effect from the date such changes are posted on the Site. At all times
                throughout your trip a government-issued photo ID is required for security checks at airports, hotels
                and car rental locations and may be required for attractions and other products as deemed necessary by
                the relevant Travel Suppliers. In addition to the required government-issued ID as stated above, proof
                of citizenship (Passport) is required for international travel (for most countries outside of the United
                States). Please note that it is your sole responsibility to ensure that you meet the passport, visa,
                and/or health requirements of the countries you wish to visit and those that you transit (even if it is
                for a simple flight change).</p>
            <p> Many countries require that your passport should be valid for a minimum period from the date of arrival
                into that country. For any questions regarding what the applicable minimum period is and any other
                conditions or passport/visa requirements for travel, you should contact the corresponding local
                consulate of the countries to which you are travelling. Neither Tripsfares.com nor its affiliates
                accept any responsibility, and you will not be entitled to any refunds whatsoever, if you are denied
                boarding, delayed or deported due to non-fulfillment of the above. Government entry/exit fees may apply,
                depending on your destination. These are your sole responsibility and will be additional to your Booking
                charges. All travellers on your Booking (if more than one passenger) must travel on the same itinerary.
                Individual passengers cannot be added to, and/or deleted from your Booking. Tripsfares.com reserves the
                right to correct errors in any advertised price and, if applicable, give you an option to either cancel
                the Booking or allow Tripsfares.com to collect an amount equal to any increase in price from your
                provided credit or debit card, prior to your departure. Each Service Element listed in your Booking is
                provided by the respective Travel Supplier. Frequent traveller points and/or miles may or may not be
                available for any portion of your Booking. You must check this with the relevant Travel Supplier. </p>
            <p>
                Once you have made your Booking, you cannot transfer or change the name(s) or destination(s) listed in
                your Booking. Your Booking will be fulfilled on the delivery date set out in your ticket information
                email or, if no delivery date is specified, then on the date the ticket is issued, unless there are
                exceptional circumstances. The terms of this agreement incorporate by reference the terms of each
                airline's contract of carriage. Passengers may inspect the full text of the contract of carriage at the
                each airline's airport or city ticket offices. Passengers have the right, upon request to the airlines,
                to receive free of charge by mail or other delivery service the full text of the contract of carriage.
                The incorporated terms of the contract of carriage may include: (1) Limits on the airline's liability
                for personal injury or death of passengers, and for loss, damage, or delay of goods and baggage,
                including fragile or perishable goods; (2) Claim restrictions, including time periods within which
                passengers must file a claim or bring an action against the airline for its acts or omissions or those
                of its agents; (3) Rights of the airline to change terms of the contract; (4) Rules about reconfirmation
                of reservations, check-in times, and refusal to carry; (5) Rights of the airline and limitations

            <p><strong>Changes to Flights Already Purchased</strong></p>

            <p>Any and all changes made to the itinerary are restricted as well as subject to airline fare rules,
                whichever is more restrictive; most of our tickets/hotels/cars/packages/cruises do not allow any date or
                name changes after the booking is completed. Tripsfares.com does not guarantee, and shall not be
                responsible for, any bookings or reservations made or confirmed to you in the event that the original
                itinerary has been changed by the supplier pursuant to customer's request. As per our "Compassion
                Exception Policy", customers who are senior citizens, in the military or physically impaired, have been
                affected by natural disasters, or are terminally ill can get a waiver on all or a portion of
                Tripsfares.com fees. Please review our Compassion Exception Policy in detail.</p>

            <p><strong>Cancel and Exchange</strong></p>

            <p>Most of our airline tickets are 100% non-refundable. In certain cases where the airline may allow
                cancellations, a credit may be valid towards a future ticket purchase by the same traveller on the same
                airline. Usually the credit issued by the airline supplier has a specific expiration date, after which
                it cannot be used. We encourage you to discuss additional restrictions attached to your credit with a
                customer service agent. All such bookings where the cancellation may be permitted must be cancelled
                prior to the scheduled departure time of the first flight segment by calling our customer service
                center. We do not guarantee any cancellation. When you are ready to make your new booking and wish to
                use your airline credit, you will be required to the pay fare difference (if any), applicable airline
                penalties and any applicable Tripsfares.com post-ticketing fees. All such changes are governed by each
                airline's fare rules, policies and procedures, which are not under our control. No additional
                representation is made for our exchange fees except that an agent will assist you in locating your
                desired new flights and attempt to re-book the new flights based on availability and other factors. As
                per our "Compassion Exception Policy", customers who are senior citizens, in the military or physically
                impaired, have been affected by natural disasters, or are terminally ill can get a waiver on all or a
                portion of the Tripsfares.com fees. Please review our Compassion Exception Policy in detail.</p>

            <p><strong>Multiple Airline Itineraries</strong></p>

            <p>If your itinerary includes flights operated by more than one airline, please read carefully each such
                airline's terms and conditions, which can be found on each such airline's website. Each such airline
                will have its own restrictions, rules and fees. If one of these flights is affected by an airline change
                (e.g. cancellation or rescheduling) that causes a Customer to make changes to the other flight, the
                Customer may be responsible for any fees or ticket cost incurred for making changes to the unaffected
                flight. Such airlines may charge their own fees for changes, refunds, or if exchanges are requested. You
                are responsible for complying with each airline's terms and conditions, which may differ (for example,
                check-in times and limits on baggage size/weight). It is advisable you print your outbound and return
                portions of your e-ticket confirmation for all flights prior to travelling. You may be asked for proof
                of your return ticket at check-in.</p>

            <p><strong>Cancel and Refund</strong></p>

            <p>Most of our airline tickets, hotels, pre-paid car rentals, vacation packages and service fees are
                non-refundable after 12 hours of booking. Trip protection insurance is refundable within 10 days of
                purchase if travel has not commenced and you have called our customer service center to cancel. All
                cancellations must be done over the phone only. We can accept refund requests only if the following
                conditions have been met: you have applied for a cancellation and refund with us and if the fare rules
                provide for cancellation and refunds; you are not a "no show" (most "no show" bookings are in-eligible
                for any waiver from suppliers for refund processing); and we are able to secure waivers from suppliers
                to process this requested cancellation and refund. We are unable to provide a specific time line for how
                long it may take for this requested refund to be processed. All refund requests are processed in a
                sequential format.</p>
            <p> Once you have provided our customer service agent with your cancellation request, we will then send you
                an email notification that your request has been received. This notification does not automatically
                qualify you for a refund. This only provides you with an acknowledgement of your request and provides
                you with a tracking number. Upon receipt of your request we will work with the suppliers such as
                airlines, hotels, car-rental companies to generate a waiver based on airline and other supplier rules
                and notify you of the supplier decision. Our services fees associated with the original travel
                reservation or booking are not refundable. Please note that we are dependent on the suppliers for
                receiving the requested refunds. Once the refund has been approved by the supplier it may take
                additional time for this to appear on your credit card statement. Generally, all suppliers will charge a
                penalty for refund. This entire process may take 60-90 days from receipt of your request to receiving
                credit on your statement. Apart from the airlines and other suppliers refund penalties, Tripsfares.com
                will charge a post-ticketing services fee, as applicable. All refund fees are charged on per ticket per
                person basis. These fees will only be assessed if a refund has been authorized by the supplier or a
                waiver has been received and when the airline/supplier rules permit such refunds. If such refund is not
                processed by the supplier, we will refund you our post-ticketing service fees applicable to your agent
                assisted refund request, but not our booking fees for the original travel reservation or booking. As per
                our "Compassion Exception Policy", customers who are senior citizens, in the military or physically
                impaired, have been affected by natural disasters, or are terminally ill can get a waiver on all or a
                portion of Tripsfares.com fees. Please review our Compassion Exception Policy in detail.Discount of

            <p>
                When you submit your credit or debit card for a purchase, we request an authorization for the amount of
                your anticipated transaction (placing a temporary "hold" on the funds). If for some reason we are unable
                to confirm your booking, you will not be charged and we will request that such hold be released by your
                credit or debit card bank; until then, funds subject to the hold will not be available to you for other
                purposes. If your credit card is declined for any reason, we will notify you within 24 hours, simply
                submitting the credit card does not automatically guarantee ticketing. Tripsfares.com bears no
                responsibility in the event your credit or debit card is not approved or charged. There can be many
                reasons why your credit or debit card may not have been approved or charged. Examples of these maybe:
                Airline could not confirm the booking, fare increased since payment information was submitted and prior
                to ticketing or sufficient funds not available on the credit card.
            </p>
            <p> In such instances where the fare may have increased, you will be provided with alternate options and you
                have the right to cancel the booking at no cost to you. When the booking is ticketed at the cost
                originally quoted to you the ticket becomes non-refundable and non-cancellable. Tripsfares.com uses
                stringent safety measures for credit card payment processing. Fraudulent transactions, if any, are
                reported to airport security, airlines and other federal and state law enforcement. You agree to be
                liable for any and all credit card payments and you agree not to dispute charges after the purchase has
                been made and your tickets and/or other products have been delivered by email confirmation or have been
                shipped to you. You agree to reimburse Tripsfares.com in cases of charge back or credit card disputes
                where you have genuinely purchased a service on our website. Most credit card transactions over the
                phone to our Customer Service Department are recorded and are available as evidence in case of any
                dispute. Online credit card transactions are authorized at the time a user or anyone acting on their
                behalf accepts these terms and conditions and continues with the purchase. In order to provide you
                further safety, when certain transactions are determined to be high risk by our systems, we will not
                process such transactions unless our credit card verification team has determined that it's safe to
                process them. In order to establish validity of such transactions, we may contact you or your bank.</p>

            <p><strong>Credit Card Declines</strong></p>

            <p>At the time of processing your transaction if your credit card declines, we will make all efforts to
                notify you by way of an email message within 3 business days. The transaction will not be processed if
                your credit card has declined. The FARE and any other booking details are NOT GUARANTEED. If there is a
                fare change then you have a right to cancel the booking at no cost to you. There will be no service fees
                charged for this.</p>

            <p><strong>Baggage Policy on Connecting Flights</strong></p>

            <p>When there are two or more airlines involved for connecting flights then you may have to reclaim your
                bags at the connecting airport and check-in again to continue your journey. You are also advised that in
                these cases if you have excess baggage, you will have to pay any excess baggage fee assessed by each
                airline. Most airlines now charge baggage fees even for the first bag checked-In, we recommend traveling
                light to reduce these costs. To locate the fees on baggage check-in by airlines, please visit our
                "Baggage Fees" page or look for a link baggage fees on our website. Baggage fees range from 15 USD up to
                100 USD or more depending on the size and weight of the bag and is per checked bag. These fees are to be
                paid directly to airline upon using such service. We make an effort to keep the baggage fees table
                updated but we recommend you contact the airline directly for the latest fees on check baggage and
                policy as it relates to baggage</p>

            <p><strong>Baggage Liability</strong></p>

            <p>For flights within the U.S., federal rules require any limit on an airline's baggage liability to be at
                least $3,300 per passenger. For international travel (including domestic portions of international
                journeys) different liability limitations apply to the loss, delay, or damage to baggage. If the
                Montreal Convention applies, the limit is 1,131 Special Drawing Rights (approximately $1700) per
                passenger unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional charges are paid. If the Warsaw
                Convention applies, the limit is approximately $9.07 per pound ($20 per kilogram) for checked baggage
                and $400 per passenger for unchecked baggage unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional
                charges are paid. Excess valuation may not be declared on certain types of valuable articles. Airlines
                assume no liability for fragile or perishable articles. Further information may be obtained from the
                airline.</p>

            <p><strong>Baggage Policy and Fees</strong></p>

            <p>If you have excess baggage, you will have to pay any excess baggage fee assessed by each airline. Most
                airlines now charge baggage fees even for the first bag checked-In, we recommend traveling light to

            <p><strong>Overbooking of Flights</strong></p>

            <p>Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that a seat will not be available on a
                flight for which a person has a confirmed reservation. If the flight is overbooked, no one will be
                denied a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their reservation in
                exchange for compensation of the airline's choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, the airline may
                deny boarding to other persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority. With few exceptions,
                including failure to comply with the carrier's check-in deadline (which are available upon request from
                the air carrier), persons denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation from the airline.
                The complete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding priorities are available
                at all airport ticket counters and boarding locations. Some airlines do not apply these consumer
                protections to travel from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be available.
